# AJAX_andRESTservice, Greg Bevington, Fall 2023

This project involved altering an existing web app to display dyanmic drop down menus for countries and provinces. 
The bulk of work here was in building a REST service to communicate with a SQL database.
Additionally, some slight changes were made to the webapp itself to make room for the drop down menus, and a SQL script was written to add some sample data to the database.
